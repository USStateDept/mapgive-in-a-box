There are many additional resources on engagement with OpenStreetMap.

For the classroom, [TeachOSM](http://teachosm.org/) is a MapGive supported resource that brings OpenStreetMap into classroom curriculum.

[LearnOSM](http://learnosm.org/) are self guided materials for the basics of contributing to OpenStreetMap.

[Planning an Open Cities Mapping Project Guide](http://www.worldbank.org/en/region/sar/publication/planning-open-cities-mapping-project) is a detailed look at organizing OSM based field projects for disaster preparedness.

The [session plan from Connect Camps Maps](http://mapgive.state.gov/events/connect-camp-maps/sessions/) has good ideas on how to organize a multi-faceted mapping session.

The [HOT Activation Protocol](http://hotosm.org/sites/default/files/HOTActivationProtocol.pdf) describes the flow of activities and roles involved in working with OpenStreetMap during a disaster response.
