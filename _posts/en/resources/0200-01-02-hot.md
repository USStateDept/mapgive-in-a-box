This is a placeholder for the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team, or [HOT](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/HOT). 

This is a placeholder, but this section should talk about these things:
- HOT as an opportunity for advanced students to make contributions of significance.
- Opportunity to learn a little about aerial imagery interpretation
- Acts as connector between mappers and the humanitarian community.
- Remote data collection and mapping on site
- Coordinate data collection and data quality
- Develops tools for mapping
