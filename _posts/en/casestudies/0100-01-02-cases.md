MapGive has been utilized in a wide variety of places and settings, and range from simple, lightly resourced events to in-depth activities with substantial design and implementation support. Take a look through these Case Studies to learn more how colleagues have implemented MapGive programs.

*Additional case studies can be found on [MapGive Stories](http://mapgive.state.gov/stories/), [OSM Institutions "Basket"](http://osmlab.github.io/basket/), and [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team Projects](http://hotosm.org/projects/ongoing).*

We'd love to highlight your MapGive projects. **Please [submit your case study](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Y4t-KKUOqvQAK3IURH256TSbjGORjIEf8c3Doa0-nI8/viewform).**
