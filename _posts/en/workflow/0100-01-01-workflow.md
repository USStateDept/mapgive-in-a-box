In this section, "How to build your workflow" educators are invited to build their own OSM assignment using tried and tested steps from the "workflows" of educators who've used OSM in the past.
Individual instructors can use the materials provided verbatim, or, they can take and modify these materials to develop assignments for their particular discipline and curricular needs.

In the following sections we will instruct how to best identify, assign, manage and grade (if applicable) a mapping assignment.


## The Assignment Workflow 
There is a lot of preparation behind a successful mapping assignment. Careful consideration is needed for the selection of a study area, assigning equitable tasks to those students, and deciding if there is to be a formal grading element to this exercise. 
Taking time to plan the assignment is crucial to a successful outcome. 

Developing a workflow for an OSM class assignment can be broken down into 3 essential steps and 2 optional depending on your project needs. 

These are:

1. Choosing where to map
2. Assigning work to participants
3. Conducting Training
4. Mapping in the field with Field Papers (OPTIONAL)
5. Grading & Quality Control (OPTIONAL)


The first three steps should be common to most assignment workflows, whether the mapping exercise takes place in a traditional classroom setting, or not. Step 4 depends on whether there is a local field mapping component possible/expected, and Step 5 suggests approaches for grading in a traditional classroom setting; again optional.
