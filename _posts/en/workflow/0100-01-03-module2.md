#STEP 2: Assigning the work
##Assigning the work
Assigning the work to your group can be done in a number of ways. For instance, work can be assigned as a quota of infrastructure to trace (i.e. 50 buildings, and/or 50 roads per student), or, one can assign designated cells to each student, or, a combination of both of these methods.  
The creation of cells is done through OSM Tasking Manager (OSM TM) and is explained in the next section. 

##TeachOSM Tasking Manager
In addition to the OpenStreetMap website, we make use of a tasking tool called TaskingManager. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) developed this tool to coordinate collaborative mapping efforts for disaster-affected areas. 

A TeachOSM arm of the tasking manager has been developed to allow for similar collaborative efforts in a classroom setting. Class instructors will need administrator rights on the TeachOSM TaskingManager website to set up a “task” or assignment. Setting up a task will involve outlining the study area, segmenting the area to be mapped, and assigning these segments to students. Visit the [TeachOSM TaskingManager](http://tasks.teachosm.org/) site to explore the tool, and to request administrative rights. 

We will go through this tool in detail in the following section (including a video guide). 

### Working with the Tasking Manager
Once you've determined your study area, you’ll now have to create a new "Job" in TeachOSM TM.  This Job will provide the students with geographic location, cell assignments and instructions.  To create new Jobs in TeachOSM TM, you need Administrative rights.  

1. Select New Project

2. TeachOSM TM job creation interface: <img src="/img/osmtm-new.png" />

3. You will be given the option to draw your study area freehand, or, to import a GeoJSON or KML file (we will proceed with the "draw" option for our demo)

4. Choose cell or tile size from from the slection bar.  Sizes range from extra large to extra small (XL - XS). XL covers more area per tile and XS covers less area per tile.  Avoid creating very large tiles. Smaller more manageable tiles are potentially less daunting to students and break the area of interest into more manageable chunks. <img src="/img/osmtm-grid.png" />

5. It is important to populate the job with a a job description, and specific instructions for the participants - even if this a reiteration of information already in class.  This space should include a note stating the Job was created as part of a class project and ask those not involved with the class to refrain from editing in this area.

### Keeping the work equitable
There are two key things to keep in mind while assigning the work: 1) equitable division of labour and 2) sufficient time for completion.  


Using the "assigned cells" method exclusively will require additional work on behalf of the instructor as they must determine the difficulty level assocated with each cell before assigning them to students. 
Instructors can set a high/medium/low designation on the density/difficulty level for each cell as some cells will have more traceable infrastructure than others.  
To do this, the grid of cells created in OSM TM will have to be exported to a desktop GIS application where the grid can be overlaid on imagery to make the difficulty determination.  This function is not available in TeachOSM TM.

If using the quota option, students will log into TeachOSM TM using their own OSM account credentials, and choose a cell in which to start tracing. They keep track of their individual quota using their personal OSM account, or, an alternate tool such as [Overpass Turbo](http://overpass-turbo.eu/) (more information on how to use this for monitoring and grading later).
