![MapGive]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/mapgive-space.png)

This section lays out the process of a [MapGive](http://mapgive.state.gov/) engagement from start to finish. A MapGive engagment involves collaborating and outreach in OpenStreetMap, in an event like a Mapthon.  The timeline to organize a MapGive engagement can vary from something thrown together in just a few days for an urgent need, to a large scale, high profile event taking several months of preparation.

## Introducing MapGive

People learn about [MapGive](http://mapgive.state.gov/) from [media coverage](http://mapgive.state.gov/mapgive-in-the-news/), [social media](https://twitter.com/mapgive), conferences, and internal recommendations. If MapGive sounds like an intriguing tool for public diplomacy, learn and try it out, understand more about the process (ie this guide!) and [get in touch]({{site.baseurl}}/en/resources/contact/).

The MapGive team is here to help support through the organization process. Start discussions over email and schedule time for a Skype or phone call if helpful.

And early on, set up a channel for regular communication and organizing among your team. Frequently, tools like [Trello](https://trello.com/) are used to keep a clear picture of preparations and responsibilities.

## Determine the Need

Mapping can be used for a wide variety of applications. There are always needs around the world in humanitarian response, and economic development. Needs can be identified that align with local priorities in the Embassy; with country and topical desks, and with local and international partners.

## Form Partnerships

There are many potential partners to help identify needs, and collaborate on all aspects of a MapGive engagement. [Form Partnships]({{site.baseurl}}/en/process/partners) has several recommendations.

## Technical Requirements: Imagery, Tasks, Stats

A MapGive engagement can have technical requirements, which the team may be able to help with.

Imagery, whether to fill a gap or provide an up to date view, is a common need. Read more about the [Imagery to the Crowd](http://mapgive.state.gov/ittc/) initiative, including how to request imagery. There are also details on [imagery coordination](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/HOT_activation#Imagery_Coordination) from the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team.

The [Tasking Manager](http://mapgive.state.gov/learn-to-map/#step-3) is often used to coordinate mapping projects. The MapGive team can help advise on selection of existing tasks, and the creation of new tasks.

Statistics and visualizations on activity in a mapping project are great motivations, and useful indicators. For example, [this page for the White House Mapathon](http://mapgive.state.gov/whmapathon/results/). There are a number of tools to use here, the team can advise.

## Plan an Event 

The [event planning guide]({{site.baseurl}}/en/process/event-planning/) has details on all aspects of holding an event, from venue, participants, agenda, and budget condsiderations. Events can be quickly organized, small scale, and informal; to something involving months of planning. Scale according to your resources available and to the kind of engagement desired.

### Field Project

Field Projects involve more substantial training than Mapathons, and collection of data in the field using GPS, mobile phones, and paper. The logistics are necessarily more complicated. However, the value of data collected in communities, by that community, is unsurpassed in depth and quality; and can help develop very substantial relationships.

This guide focuses on Mapathon events, but there are [Resources]({{site.baseurl}}/en/resources/) which cover field projects in more detail (especially the OpenCities Guide), and the [Cusco Field Project Case Study]({{site.baseurl}}/en/cases/cusco/) is helpful. Get in touch with the MapGive team, and we can discuss more.

### Communications / Publicity

Communication is crucial before, during, and after the event. Spread the word via whichever mediums are most appropriate; email, social media, news media, blog posts, etc. [Form Partnerships]({{site.baseurl}}/en/process/partners) can help you decide on your target audiences.
 
The [MapGive Social Media Toolkit]({{site.baseurl}}/files/CompleteMapGiveSocialMediaToolkit.docx) can assist you in publicizing your event and connect with a broader audience. The key is to begin messaging in advance and to choose a relevant #hashtag so that the activity is easy to follow and potentially engage a larger community. Tweet @MapGive for support broadcasting your event.
 
And, events come and go, but swag lasts forever. Or, at least, for a while. The MapGive team keeps “MapGive” and “I Mapped” stickers on hand for events and outreach, which can be proudly displayed and viewed from many mappers’ laptops and notebooks. Consider procuring some kind of swag, as fun freebees or prizes for participants, to keep the event engaging and continue gaining exposure afterwards.

### Follow Up / Review

Critical, but often untended, are substantial follow ups. Events take a lot of energy to organize. Make sure to include follow ups in planning. This can include immediate thank yous to partners and participants. And further, establish points of contact and spaces for further communication and future collaborations.

And after your event happens, **please [submit your case study](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Y4t-KKUOqvQAK3IURH256TSbjGORjIEf8c3Doa0-nI8/viewform).**
